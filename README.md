# iCare-Blood

## Sample C++ semester project for Computer Science students.

**This is my C++ semester 2 project back in diploma days.**

This project, namely blood system management is known to be a pilot project that is designed for the community or known as blood bank to gather blood from various sources and distribute it to the needy people who seek for certain type of blood type within the zip code radius. This project is designed to record the donator details and the receiver may search for donator nearby by using the postal code. The system also capable to register numerous number of donor in a single run, and this donator details can be search under the reeiver section. The program is designed in such manner that it can suit the needs of all the blood bank requirements in the course of future.

### Instructions:
- Run system by open the iCare Blood.exe
- To modified the code, import the folder to any C++ compiler.

Note that: The data entered is not stored to any database. It just a single-run operation system which keep all the data entered in array variable.
